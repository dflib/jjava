# JJava

JJava is a Java kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) maintained by the [DFLib.org](https://dflib.org) community. 
The kernel executes code via the JShell tool. Some of the additional commands are supported via a syntax similar to the IPython magics. 

_JJava is an evolution of the earlier [IJava kernel](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava), that is no longer maintained by its authors._

## Requirements

1.  Java JDK >= 11
2.  A Jupyter-like environment to use the kernel in.

## Install pre-built binary

1.  Download the release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/dflib/jjava/releases).
2.  Unzip it into a temporary location.
3.  Run the `install.py` script with the same version of Python as used by Jupyter.
